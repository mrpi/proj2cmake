# proj2cmake
Convert an entire Visual Studio solution and all contained projects to CMake.

The output is split into multiple files:
 - CMake files that contain the lists of sources and dependencies between the projects in the solution
 - CMake files that can be edited by the user and where the platform specific settings and compiler settings belong

Only the first onces will be overwritten on further runs of proj2cmake. So it is designed to keep the CMake files in sync with the VS solution.

This project is currently in an early state and may not work correctly for your Visual Studio projects.
